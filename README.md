## Welcome 👋

We are excited to start the technical interview process for an Android engineer at Wattpad 🎉

## Overview
This project fetches the list of stories using an endpoint and displays it in a `RecyclerView`.
But it does it in a very inefficient way and we think it can be optimised.

## Task
Spend some time understanding the codebase. Then you need to find out all the problems/inefficiencies in this project and walk us through how you will optimise/refactor the project.
Next, you need to implement one of the optimisation that you choose.

We're are looking for an opportunity to observe your problem solving & engineering skills and how you explain the solution to us.
We don't expect them to finish the task given lack of time.

Good luck 🍀
